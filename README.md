Spinning Cube Project using Three.js
This is a project of a spinning cube created using Three.js. The cube rotates around its x and y axes, creating a simple animation. The code is written in JavaScript and can be run in a web browser.
Getting Started
To run this example, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. You should see a spinning cube rendered on the page.
Dependencies
This example uses Three.js, a JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in a web browser. The library is included via a script tag in the index.html file, so there are no additional dependencies to install.
Code Structure
The code is contained in a single HTML file (index.html). The Three.js library is included via a script tag at the top of the file. The rest of the code defines the scene, camera, renderer, and cube, as well as the animation function that updates the cube's rotation.

Credits
This project was created by Jan Michael Chege. The spinning cube animation was inspired by the Three.js documentation and examples.
